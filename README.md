# odin-recipes

This project is a website of three recipes using only html to format it.
I implemented ordered lists and unordered lists. I used relative links to navigate from the main page to the desired recipe. Also, images were used from local files along with alternative text to aid with screen reading. Made use of the different headings based on their priority. And lastly published a website for the first time.
